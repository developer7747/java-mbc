        Physician groups are increasingly opting for centralized medical billing services.
        Centralised billing solutions help in cost sharing and utilization of resources
        effectively. This leads to saving time, enhanced patient care, and is a lucrative
        method of running the practice.
        <p class="subheading">
                Common problems that face physician groups with an in-house billing system are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shortage of experienced staff and medical billing resources in the market</li>
            <li>Management and retention of billing staff </li>
            <li>Spending a high percentage of capital on the rental space for medical billing related
                activities and storage</li>
            <li>Incurring administration and processing services costs and managing various vendors</li>
            <li>Time constraint and focus constraint as the same resource needs to run day to day
                activities and recover maximum revenue</li>
            <li>Dedicated Supervision and a team to monitor, stay updated with the latest changes</li>
            <li>Process claims, Collect accounts receivable (A/R), and worry about cash flow</li>

            immensely. Physicians have seen a <span class="bluecolor"><strong>40% increase</strong></span>
            in their net revenue by outsourcing to a reliable partner like MBC. Outsourcing
            medical billing and collections could actually increase the bottom-line by approximately
            $254,000 or 20% for physician groups.
