                    <p>Physicians across the nation have been struggling to find a professional who can relieve them of their administrative chores so that they can face the challenges of providing quality healthcare. Most physicians would rather prefer a specialist taking care of the reimbursement process and maximize their revenue but they are tirelessly looking for the rest to manage their revenue cycle management.</p>

            MBC provides fully customized consulting services to healthcare providers in terms
            of program expertise, analytical services, and revenue cycle management, no matter
            the size of your operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Healthcare is a dynamic industry which has been revolutionized by far reaching changes
            enabled by IT in the recent times. With numerous updates on government regulations
            impacting everyday healthcare processes and decisions for patients, physicians,
            and insurers alike, it takes an expert to evaluate and determine their potential
            effects on each at micro as well as macro level.</p>
        <h2>
            Why do you require expert consultancy services?</h2>
        <p>
            As the industry attempts to realign the relationship between key stakeholders in
            the healthcare scheme by removing the lacunae and ambiguities, the healthcare providers
            at all levels are likely to need professional support to meet these transformational
            changes. Consuming nearly 16% of the national GDP, healthcare is an important sector
            to be considered for revenue generation optimization and with community hospitals
            running into losses and rural healthcare struggling with unattractive remuneration,
            there is an urgent need for expert professional consultation to stimulate the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Payersâ€™ propensity to deny claims at the slightest opportunity further
            complicates the issue and makes it imperative to utilize professional support for
            pro-active revenue cycle management.
        </p>

            MBC understands the rapidly transforming healthcare scenario and provides end-to-end
            solutions for the implementation of your strategic, operational, and financial purposes.

        <h2>
            Assuring regulatory compliance

        <p>
            How do MBC consultancy services provide you an edge over your competitors? We offer
            our skills and experience in the healthcare industry to ensure that you can cope
            with its sweeping innovations as well as prepare for the broad spectrum of healthcare
            compliances and accreditations.</p>
        <p>
            The changing face of healthcare services has introduced latest compliances such
            as <strong>HIPAA 5010, ICD10, PQRI</strong> (Physician Quality Reporting Initiative),
            <strong>CPOE</strong> (Computerized Physician Order Entry), <strong>HIE </strong>
            (Health Information Exchange), and the latest <strong>EHR</strong> updates which
            we can help to implement and integrate into your system with minimum hiccups during
            the transition process. But adopting these compliances with a reluctant team can
            be difficult. What your system may require is a knowledgeable motivator expert in
            the revenue cycle management.
        </p>
        <p>

            How can you optimize your returns with our Revenue Cycle Management Solutions?</h2>
        <p>
            MBC can assist you in a thorough scrutiny of your revenue cycle and assess areas
            of deficiencies and make recommendations for potential improvement after analyzing
            your situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Our revenue cycle management experts can identify and expose the revenue leakages
                and inefficiencies by a multi-pronged analysis of areas such as</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="padding: 0 0 0 20px;list-style:none">Training needs</li>
            <li style="padding: 0 0 0 20px;list-style:none">Workforce Optimization</li>
            <li style="padding: 0 0 0 20px;list-style:none">Software inadequacies</li>
            <li style="padding: 0 0 0 20px;list-style:none">Outdated processes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These common issues often result in registration errors, little or no pre-verification
            of insurance coverage, and an absence of an effective collection policy for insurance
            deductibles and co-pays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, analyzing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.medicalbillersandcoders.com/revenue-management-services.aspx?DivId=3">
                Account Receivables</a> reports with in-depth research of payer-wise, patient-wise,
            and service-wise receivables helps to establish the blockages in the cash flows
            which can then be resolved easily.</p>
        <p>
            The ability to avoid RAC audits and the importance of refunds to Medicare in time,
            when there has been an overpayment invariably need the attention of a specialist.
            Pointing out these technicalities and helping your team implement these in their
            daily practices, is the task of our consultants in your office.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our experienced Revenue cycle management consultants boost your revenues, improve
            your staff performance, and streamline your existing processes and interoperability
