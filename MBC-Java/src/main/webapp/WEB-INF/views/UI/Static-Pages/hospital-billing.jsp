            MBC Deciphers Core Problem Areas in Hospital Billing</h2><p></p>
        <p>
            Hospitals are primarily concerned with providing optimum patient care. However patient
            care, operational efficiency and revenue generation are pressing issues that can
            make or break a practice or a hospital.</p>
        <p>
            Hospital billing is a complex subject and one that is affected by continuous changes.
            It is therefore critical that hospitals entrust their medical billing requirements
            in the hands of experts. Research indicates that errors in hospital billing
                are an extensive problem affecting the healthcare industry with around 30% to 40%
                bills containing errors. This has deep ramifications on the functioning
            of hospitals which are always under financial constrain.

            Billing problems faced by hospitals</h2></div>
        Erroneous billing is a huge problem affecting most hospitals and private practices.
        Without adequate resolution of this problem, hospitals risk losing thousands of
        dollars in revenue each year.
        <ul>
            <li>Charge capturing &amp; Claim problems:Many hospitals experience problems
                of incomplete claims, claim denials and incomplete charge capturing. In many cases
                the system is not properly designed and medical billing professionals find it difficult
                to deal with problems of missing information. What hospitals require is an exhaustive
                and comprehensive charge and claim verification procedure to ensure services are
                billed correctly.Unlike a practice, hospitals have various people who handle
                    the patient information thus processes are difficult to correct if information is
                    incomplete. </li>
            <li>Insurance Verification problems: Insurance verification is an important
                step and without proper verification, claims may be denied. Eligibility issues may
                result in loss of time and requirement for rework on the claims due to patient ineligibility.
            </li>
            <li>Complexity of Emergency Room Billing:Emergency room hospital billing
                is a complex issue and many hospitals and private practices lose money due to improper
                tracking or inability to report the treatment under the urgent care criteria. Comprehensive
                experience and familiarity with ER billing is critical in ensuring higher patient
                collections. </li>
            <li>Hospitals pending Account Receivables: Cash generation through
                account receivables is critical as it ensures healthy revenue or cash flow streams
                within the hospitals. Timely identification of uncollected claims and regular follow-ups
                are required for conversion of uncollected claims into cash flow. Hospital AR generally
                runs into 120 days which is highly detrimental to RCM.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Using the AR bucketing approach, though the easiest and the most logical approach
            to handling huge AR accounts but is not followed by many accounting departments.
            Variations of Payer specific and code specific AR is still a more remote concept
            for many hospitals managing their revenues in-house.</p>
        <div>
            <h2 class="h1tagdivicdtraining">
            Why don’t hospitals outsource in the first place?</h2></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Most hospitals believe that in-house hospital billing professionals and practice
                administrators can autonomously deal with billing procedures and resolve issues
                ensuing from it. </li>
            <li>Hospitals are also wary of sharing sensitive data through outsource of multimillion/
                billion dollar collections. </li>
            <li>Hospitals fear losing control by having to depend on external experts for their
                billing requirements. </li>
            <li>Hospitals often believe that outsourcing of medical billing requirements will be
                very expensive, though sometimes, it is difficult to predict the loss of revenue
                that is incurred due to erroneous billing by in-house staff. </li>
        </ul>
