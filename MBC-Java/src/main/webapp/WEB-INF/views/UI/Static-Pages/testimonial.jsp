As you know, my private Optometry practice has been in operation for almost 60 years, and I have been the owner for the past 15 years. Since the purchase of my practice, in-office medical billing has been a problem. For years, I hired in-office employees to provide the billing services, and there were problems always.</p><p>Problems were always when the employee wanted time off; nothing was billed, lack of knowledge, laziness, and gaps between hiring new employees. I even had one biller that if the insurance needed additional work to process she just ignored it and wrote the balance off without my knowledge.</p><p>I can't even calculate how much money was lost over the years, and wonder if I knew about your services earlier, what the practice would be like today.</p><p>My Client Servicing &amp; Operations Manager from MedicalBillersandCoders.com is always available either via email or by phone. He runs a tight ship, and figures out problems before they occur. Our weekly conference call is a valuable tool, and I am still getting used to having such thorough communications.</p><p>Money is flowing into my practice regularly now, with daily insurance submission. Any medical practice that wants an efficient medical billing company should call these people.</p></div>

This is an area that separates a better billing company from the rest.  Their coders have been able to read operative notes and understand which series of codes and modifiers are needed for proper medical billing and maximum reimbursement resulting in a 98-99% return.</p><p>They have been very easy to reach and returned messages promptly. Patients were provided with a toll free number for easy access. Hours of operation are clearly stated and honored which is a plus to either myself or my patients that have questions. It was extremely helpful that the company assigned a client service manager to me in the beginning who was knowledgeable and easy to reach anytime day or night. It made me feel safe to know that issues and questions will be resolved in an efficient manner.</p><p>The billing company has offered a variety of reports on all of my billing activities, as well as customizable reports which has made it easy to see where I am at in billings, paid and accounts pending.  Year-end productivity reports were also offered which could be customized by provider, by procedure, or by location.  All requested reports were detailed, accurate, and timely.</p><p>I would highly recommend them from any independent practice as well as large groups.  In fact, I have recommended them to several colleagues.</p></div>

We manage a free standing emergency room in Bedford, Ohio and we needed a company that would credential us with all the insurance companies including Medicare/Medicaid and also do our billing and coding. By Godâ€™s grace we came across MBC on the internet. Having been disappointed by other billing services in the past, we were pleasantly surprised at how great this company has been to us. They got us credentialed in time and established our billing cycles on time and overall they have been a great help. They are always there to answer our questions and work with other vendors who we have to use for various other issues. This is a great company, doing an excellent job. Personally on behalf of myself and my company, </p><p>I thank you very much and trust that you will be open to helping others in the same way that you helped us.</p><p>Thank you very much, keep up the great work!</p></div>
