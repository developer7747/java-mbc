				<p>Podiatrists refer patients for many radiology investigations

					specialist medical practitioners, or for pathology testing.
					Representing the physician at all points is the correspondence,
					hence these reports have to be accurate and customized as per the
					podiatrist.</p>
				<p>Accuracy, quality and turn around being the most important
					aspects for them, our medical transcriptionists have been the first
					choice of podiatrists. Well-documented reports within a 24-hour TAT
					as well as flexible dictation options of toll free dictation and
					digital recorder have made podiatrists recommend our services to
					many in their field.</p>
