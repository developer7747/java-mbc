                            Our billers believe that accuracy of the claim and the time spent on retrieving
                the payment are key points in optimized revenue collections. Our aim is to improve
                the client's cash flow by reducing days in accounts receivable and improving profitability,
                by increasing collections ratio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our billers identify category/payer combinations and work on resolving the mix that
                results in the best collections. They prioritize the claims by dollar value and
                date of service. They organize the Account Receivables timeline wise (AR days between
                30 to 45 days, 45 days to 60 days and beyond 60 days)and work on critical claims
                first.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our billers are well versed in identifying patient accounts that require follow-up
                and take the necessary action to collect unpaid and partially paid claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Billers in our consortium run reports on account 21 days past due and call insurance
                companies to check claim status, re-file, or gather additional information. They
                keep the average age of account receivable at 25 days or less.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has been observed that revenues for most clinics are stuck in this stage where
                Insurance Follow up is not a priority. Thousands of dollars are waiting to be collected
                but follow up with long hold periods on the phone with Insurance companies is tedious
                and must be minimized with efficient maneuvers of IVRs.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our billers have spent years doing this, some of them have such established relations
                and great understanding of claim status that they don't even pick up the phone to
                follow up. They know their jobs!
                        </p>
