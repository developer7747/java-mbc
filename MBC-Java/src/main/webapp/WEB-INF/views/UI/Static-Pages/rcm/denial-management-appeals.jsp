                    <p>
                        Denials are an epidemic to the financial health of most practices, and they have
                a need to be treated well in order to get you financial success. 10% of the physician
                revenue is estimated to be lost due to lack of denial management process.

                            Billers in our association are experts in denial management analysis. This helps
                in preventing denials and revenue losses in the first place. But if you do have
                denials from the past then let them be handled by our Billers and Coders and see
                them getting paid easily.

                            The process of Denial Management has only one key – ANALYSIS, once the root cause
                of denial is figured, correcting it and getting paid for it is not a task. The skill
                of a specialist is required to get the perfect analysis into a claim.

                        <p>
                            Denial claims also require "Appeals" – Appeals are requests and explanation of the
                claim sent earlier and conditions on which the claim now is again eligible for payment.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some appeals are time sensitive. Our Billers review your most commonly denied claims,
                prioritizing both for volume and dollar value and file them in a timely manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Considering the cost of appealing claims (both in terms of time and money) also
                helps our billers decide whether they must appeal the claim at all. So they will
                not appeal every claim but know the fact that many practices lose great sums of
                income every year because they don't appeal denied claims.
